        <h2> Hi!</h2>
        <article class="about">
            <p>Welcome to my blog. This site is to host information on my previous work experience and give viers a look into my life. I grew up in Brighton, Michigan and lived there until the end of high school. After graduating from Brighton High School, I went to get my bachelor’s degree in supply chain management with a minor in information technology. I have two siblings, who both also attended MSU. In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with my roommates, watching movies and rock climbing. I include photos below of my hometown, family and more!</p>
            <p>Thanks for stopping by my online webpage! Feel free to check out more of my professional experience on the “My Work” section. </p>
